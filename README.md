# spiffe

## Overview
A fully electromagnetic 2.5-dimensional particle-in-cell code designed for simulating RF guns and similar systems with cylindrical symmetry. **spiffe** complies with the SDDS standard.

## Features
- **2.5-Dimensional Particle-In-Cell Simulation:** Tailored for RF gun design.
- **SDDS Output:** Generates output files compatible with elegant.

## Input and Output
- **Input:** Provide configuration files detailing simulation parameters, grid setup, and particle initialization.
- **Output:** The simulation generates SDDS-formatted files for use with elegant, facilitating further analysis and visualization.

## Documentation
